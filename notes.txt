Creating random data partitions
Analysts need an unbiased evaluation of the quality of their machine learning models. To get
this, they partition the available data into two parts. They use one part to build the machine
learning model and retain the remaining data as "hold out" data. After building the model,
they evaluate the model's performance on the hold out data. This recipe shows you how to
partition data. It separately addresses the situation when the target variable is numeric and
when it is categorical. It also covers the process of creating two partitions or three.
